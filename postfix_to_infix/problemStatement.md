# PostFix to Infix Conversion
My perfect sunday morning is a cup of tea, a croissant, and beautiful code.

This repo contains solutions to various programming exercises. Each folder corresponds to one programming exercise, and contains a README describing that exercise. It will also contain solutions in different languages.

Why? Good practice is good, and code is fun :D
