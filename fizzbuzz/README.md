### FizzBuzz!

FizzBuzz is a computer science classic and a fun interview-style question.

This folder provides a JavaScript implementation, in which we'll be using JS terminology throughout, as well as a Golang implementation.

Given an array of integers, iterate through the array and log the following values:
* 'fizz' if the integer is a multiple of 3, but NOT 5
* 'buzz' if the integer is a multiple of 5, but NOT 3
* 'fizzbuzz' if the integer is a multiple of 3 AND 5
* the integer itself in any other case

This example exercise in `fizzbuzz.js` provides a quick solution, as well as a function to aid testing.
